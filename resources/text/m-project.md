An active project of my current full-time job.
Long story short, this is a massive amount of planning, drawing, code and engineering work of several folks to reach a single goal - create an interactive 1:10 size submarine prototype. Why so? Well, “The Organization” I work on is related to marine topic, so this project is some kind of our knowledge showcase to inspire / excite our guests with marine topic.

Since topic is wide, this project includes many things even on just a code side, such as working with low-level programming, microcontrollers, web and mobile development and etc.

My role of a software architect includes: stack research, development of an entire IoT platform from scratch, writing a firmware code, development of the touchscreen friendly dashboard to control the whole project and many other local pieces of a puzzle, like plugins for CAD software.
