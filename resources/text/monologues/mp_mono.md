An active project of my current full-time job.

Long story short, this is a co-op project with a massive amount of work in planning, designing, coding and engineering stuff to reach a single goal - to produce an interactable real-world 1:10 size submarine prototype. Why so? Well, “The Organization” I work on belonges to marine topic, so this project is some kind of our knowledge showcase to inspire / excite our visitors.

My role of a software architect includes: stack research, development of an entire decentralized IoT platform from scratch, writing firmware code, development cross-platform dashboard to interact with a real-world project protoype and other pieces of a puzzle, like plugins for CAD software or libs to work with unknown LCD screens and misc electronics (I noted last two guys, because they makes me doomed).

This project is a great skill boost for me, since I find a new stuff about microcontrollers industry and now I can potentially start to make things I'm not supposed to do... :)
