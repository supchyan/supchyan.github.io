Once upon a time, I got bored of Windows taskbar and decided to look for alternatives. 

During research I figured out, that Windows taskbar is not something, that ppl like to re-write. Even knowing about Windhawk and it's plugins, I wouldn't be able to modify stuff I wanted to, so writing a taskbar from scratch was only a matter of time...

Lolibar is C# lib for creating almost any taskbar / statusbar you want. It has decent documentation and examples section. If you want to try it, you're welcome! It has an open-source on my GitHub!

By the way, kind a doom to realize now, what an enormous amount of job taskbars in operation systems do, but my brain definitely became bigger during this project. 

Understanding OS parts in attempts to write something already existing is such a nice experience...
