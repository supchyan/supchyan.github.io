"Failed to pair a device. Main server cannot be reached.", - said my smart home app when I wanted to setup recently brought "smart" lamp.

De:things - decentralized things, is the project about communication between devices and frontend applications in decentralized networks. I don't wanna handle my air cooler through a China-Motherland server, I want to send a request directly, because I stand in half meters of it.

"What if you will be few kilometers away from your network, how do you plan to control your smart home then?"

What if I won't?

It's kinda dumb, that modern IoT industry surrounded by global servers, prevents you as a customer to link a new divice in a local network if something like "...Main server cannot be reached." happens. I want to have a choice my guys.

Home Assistant, you say. Too complicated for basic IoT interactions, I confront... As well as I want to use Ethernet as one of supported protocols for my setup. I live in country where you never know, what will happen tomorrow.

De:things based on Arduino / ESP controllers community, so if you ever playied with Arduino and it's IDE, you can take a look this project on my GitHub. It has an open-source organization page for everyone. It's pretty simple and easy to get into, since I really want to just control my devices with requests over local network.
