I like rhythm games, especially Taiko no Tatsujin. I'm also a big fun of osu!taiko, but playing it for like 8 years in a row makes me to think: "What if somebody will make a Taiko game, but edgy and for modile platforms?". So me do! 

I won't explain anything about this project here, since it's in early state of development, because I'm out of time to work on it, but trust me, when I'll focus on the development process, anyone related to the rhythm games topic will lock in.

I use Defold as a core engine for this project and I highly recommend it, if you plan to develop games for mobile platforms. It's very optimized, lightweight, so you can run your game in a native frame-rate with zero perfomance losses. Very decent game engine for sure.

P.S. *Blinking* Help me to find a time to focus on this project quicker ;v;
