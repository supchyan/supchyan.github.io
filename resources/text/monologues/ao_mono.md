I like rhythm games, especially Taiko no Tatsujin. I'm also a big fun of osu!taiko, but playing it for like 8 years in a row makes me to think: "What if somebody will make a Taiko game, but edgy and for mobile platforms?". So me do! 

I won't explain anything about this project here, since it's in early state of development, because I'm out of time to work on it, but trust me, when I'll focus on the development process, the game will be interesting to look at.

I use Defold as a core engine for this project and I highly recommend it, if you plan to develop games for mobile platforms. It's very optimized, lightweight, so you can run your game in a native frame-rate with a minimal perfomance loss. Very decent game engine for sure.

P.S. *blink* Help me to find a time to focus on this project, I don't wanna be an office clerk, *sniff* ;v;
